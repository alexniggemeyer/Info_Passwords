Making better passwords - tips,,,,
,,,,
DONTS,,,,
Passwords should not be the same as the User ID,"login: chris1, password: chris1  D'oh!",,,
,,,,
Don't use the same passwords as everybody else,The first thing a hacker will do is check against a list of common passwords.,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/1/
,4.7% of users have the password 'password'. ,,,https://xato.net/wp-content/xup/passwordsfreq.png

,,,,
Don't use words in the dictionary,This leaves you vulnerable to a dictionary attack.,,,http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/dictionary-attack
,A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer or server by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password.,,,http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/dictionary-attack
,,,,
BEST PRACTICE,,,,
Make your passwords long,Minimum of 11 characters.,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/3/
,,,,
,"Once an exhaustive (brute force) password search begins, the most important factor is password length.",,,https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm
,This is because short passwords (<5-7 characters) can easily be cracked using a brute force attack alone.,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/2/
,"(A brute force attack is one that tries every possible combination of letters, numbers and symbols)",,,https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm
,,,,
,Add password padding to make passwords longer.,,,https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm
,,,,
,For example:,,,
,,,,
,Passw0rd/////////////,,,
,,,,
"Use a mix of caps and lowercase, numbers and special characters","Passwords must contain at least one of each of the following: one alphabetic uppercase, one alphabetic lowercase, one numeric, and one special character.",,,https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm
,,,,
,"For example, the very weak password:",,,
,news,,,
,,,,
,"If another lowercase character was added to it, for example to form:",total password search space is increased by...,,
,newsy,26 times,,
,,,,
,If an exclamation point is added:,,,
,news!,1530 times,,
,,,,
,"Since most users will likely always be choosing all lowercase characters you'll want to stay as far away from that as possible. And, similarly, the fewest number of users will ever be using many special symbol characters. So the wisest attacker will aim for the herd, searching through lowercase passwords first and symbol-oriented passwords last. Since this is one race which you want to finish last (meaning never) using more symbol characters is highly recommended.",,,https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm
,,,,
But don't simply stick a string of numbers on the end of your existing password,Especially if it's your year of birth. Crackers will try passwords like 'keith1985' early on.,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/2/
,,,,
,Using number strings at the end of words leaves you vulnerable to hybrid attacks.,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/2/
,A hybrid attack marries a dictionary attack with a brute-force attack.,,,
,For example:,,,
,,,,
,A cracker can append all possible four-characters strings containing digits or symbols to the end of each word in his dictionary,,,
,,,,
Be creative with the positioning special characters,"Put numbers, caps and symbols at unusual points in the middle of the word for added security. ",,,http://www.passwordmeter.com/
,,,,

,,,,
,"Passwords show surprising uniformity when it comes to the types of characters used in each position—in general, capital letters come at the beginning, lower-case letters come in the middle, and symbols and numbers come at the end.

",,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/2/
,This leaves them vulnerable to Markov attacks.,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/2/
,A Markov attack makes highly educated guesses. It analyzes plains to determine where certain types of characters are likely to appear in a password.,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/2/
,,,,
But don't build your password entirely out of special characters,"Not only symbols, since you first want to have every type of character represented to force a “full depth” search.",,,https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm
,,,,
Your password doesn't have to be difficult to remember,"Which of the following two passwords is stronger,",,,https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm
,"more secure, and more difficult to crack?",,,

,,,,
,"You probably know this is a trick question, but the answer is: Despite the fact that the first password is HUGELY easier to use and more memorable, it is also the stronger of the two! In fact, since it is one character longer and contains uppercase, lowercase, a number and special characters, that first password would take an attacker approximately 95 times longer to find by searching than the second impossible-to-remember-or-type password!",,,
,,,,
"And pass phrases can be better than passwords, even complex passwords","For example, four random common words like:",Time to guess at 1000 guesses / sec,,https://xkcd.com/936/
,correct horse battery staple,550 years,,
,,,,
,Is better than one weird word with special characters like,,,
,Tr0ub4dor&3,3 days,,
,,,,
,"because it's both longer, and easier to remember",,,
,,,,
Even these can be vulnerable,"One type of hybrid attack is a combinator attack. It combines each word in a dictionary with every other word in the dictionary, yielding a huge number of guesses.",,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/3/
,,,,
,Crackers can observe how words are commonly combined in already-cracked passwords to build up a list of 'rules'.,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/3/

"Best solution: long, random passcodes",These can only be cracked by brute force,,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/3/

Create a unique password for each site,"Once your password has been cracked, it can be used across other sites too.",,,http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/3/
,,,,
,,,,
"If you can't remember them all, use a password manager",for example LastPass ,,,https://lastpass.com/
,or KeePass,,,http://keepass.info/
,or Password Genie,,,http://www.securitycoverage.com/passwordgenie/overview.php
,,,,
,Password managers remember your passwords for you and fill in your login details automatically when you enter a site. (This also creates an obstacle for keytrackers.),,,
,,,,
,All you have to remember is the single master password that logs you in to the password manager.,,,
,,,,
,Which should also follow the rules above.,,,
